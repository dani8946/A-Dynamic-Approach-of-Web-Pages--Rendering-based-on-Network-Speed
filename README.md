# Optimization of Web Page based on Network Bandwidth
This Chrome extension is designed to monitor and optimize your browsing experience based on your network speed. It provides a seamless way to check your current bandwidth and dynamically renders optimized versions of web pages to ensure smooth performance, especially when network speeds are below optimal levels.

In addition to the original web page (Version 1 or V1), we have developed two more optimized versions:
           1) Version 2 (V2): Integrates Script Minification and Image Compression to reduce page load time and enhance performance on moderately slow networks.
           2) Version 3 (V3): Integrates Script Minification along with Caption Generation for better accessibility and context. Since caption generation can take longer to process, an alternative version using 
                              Script Minification with Alternate Text (Alt Text) is also included for faster rendering when needed.
These different versions (V1, V2, and V3) are dynamically rendered based on real-time network speed measurements, ensuring that users always receive the most suitable version for their current connectivity conditions.
